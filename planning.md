Cartoons: More Than Silly

What about cartoons make them capitvating? Why would I want to watch a silly cartoon?

	To the laymen, a cartoon may look like a waste of time. Nothing more than idiotic filler content to "rot your brain", and yes, when you watch a few minutes of burger flipping underwater sponge with a starfish best friend going out jellyfishing or getting stuck on hooks, or a blue cat constantly getting into trouble with his fish best friend that can somehow live out of water, yeah I could see how someone might find that a little strange. However, I think it's important to remember where most of us have our intoduction to the medium of cartoons, our childhood.  A time where life for most can be described as nothing more than free, free of all the problems that come along with the real world and where life is full of endless possibilities. A place where you have nothing but time to cultivate the limitlessness of imagination and dreams. A time I think if you talk to any adult, almost all would ask to go back to. At it's core, cartoons are just that, an expression of imagination and dreams.


What makes cartoons resonate?

	 Shows like Adventure Time, Amazing World of Gumball, Fairly Odd Parents, and Gravity Falls. Shows like the superheros of DC and Marvel. Anime like Naruto, My Hero Acedamia, and One Piece. Why do shows like these have such large followings of all ages? Well, on the surface, they're just fun! That's what's great about this medium. You can express actions, emotions, and overall story in a way that is very difficult to replicate compared to its live action counterpart. However, what cannot be ignored if you pay attention is these stories often times deal with higher levels and complexities of life that offer hidden lessons and perspectives that I feel earn them their well deserved respective audiences. Complexities like growing up, right, wrong and the grey area, reaching your potential, and so on. It's complexities like these that make these shows not just something to watch, but something to think about and possibly apply to real life. They say it's good to learn from your lessons, but a wise man learns from other's lessons, or something like that. Well that applies here in these stories, just as they have for all forms of story media throughout the ages.


The evolution of animation

	Animation is an involved and difficult medium to pull off. Take a 22 minute episode for your favorite tv show. The industry standard is 24 frames per second. PER SECOND! If my math is correct, that means a standard episode could contains up to 31,680 frames (depending on production budget, scene type, etc), or in other words the people who take the time deserve some recognition. It's no wonder early production houses like Walt Disney required large teams to pull off without the help of the digital age, using early methods like cel and multiplane animation. Everything was hand done. As the medium developes new technologies, creators contiune to push the envelop for what is possible. As the digital age fell apon us, technologies like digital painting and 3D build upon previous methods to create faster, smoother, and eye popping animations. Even making it possible if one decides to take on the challenge to create stunning studio level animation on their own with nothing more than a computer and willpower. Since the days of black and white Mickey Mouse and the rubberhose style, animation has pushed limits. From character physics to world building and new technologies, the medium has developed a vast and colorful catalog to entertain all sorts of audiences. As technologies evolve one thing remains constant, the necessity of good story and characters for the audience. Here's to the future of animation, and the stories to come.
